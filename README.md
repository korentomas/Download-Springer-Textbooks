# Download Springer textbooks by category
We found out that Springer Publishing, a publisher specializing in books and academic journals, released more than 400 publications due to the global context. We thought this was great and wanted to contribute in our own way.

We wanted to automatize the download for all textbooks so we decided to program an algortihm in python but we googled it and realized that **Joe T. Santhanavanich** published an article where he did this. In the comments we also found that **[@juanluisrto](https://gist.github.com/juanluisrto)** made some code to categorize the already downloaded files.

# NO PYTHON NEEDED. YOU CAN USE AN EXECUTABLE FILE! :D
# IF AN ERROR SAYING "unknown" POPS UP, THIS MEANS SPRINGER REMOVED THIS BOOK'S DOWNLOAD LINK

What our program does is only to download the categories the user is interested in + we added a few functions:
- **It has an EXE file so anyone can download the books without having to install Python!**
- The user can choose which category to download through the terminal.
- Folders will only be created for those selected categories.
- The user can see how many files have been downloaded out of the total.
- We have intended to make the code more user-friendly but we are still working on it.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download the ZIP

3. Oops, Windows will detect this as not safe (you can check the python files and you'll see everything is in order). You can fix this by pressing More Info then Run anyway
